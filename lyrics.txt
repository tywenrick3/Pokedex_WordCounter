Lying awake all weekend
Like a bug stuck in a Venus flytrap
Am I supposed to hold out darling
We don't have forever
I'm just a bug
I'm just a bug and I'm yours to slowly digest
To her I came just to lay and rest my head
Her firm embrace, it would make my final bed
Mother Nature takes no prisoners
But I'll never leave these living walls
You got me seduced in fluent haiku
I'll be abused if that means I can lie beside you
Where I'll dissolve
Into the colors on the forest floor
And far above
The butterflies flutter by
But I won't buzz along
To her I came just to lay and rest my head
Her firm embrace, it would take my final breath
But Mother Nature decides
That's why
She'll always rule and you'll abide it
That's what I did too
Just lie to die
I'm in love
